---------------------------------------------------CHANGELOG---------------------------------------------------
V1.0.4:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this update was unintended but i realised it would be incredibly easy to fix results menu items, so all
previous character changes now have complete icon replacement for character select, minimap, and results menu
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V1.0.3:
------------------------------------------------new-replacements:----------------------------------------------
BABY PEACH --> PIKACHU
DAISY --> TAILS
YOSHI --> STEVE
DONKEY KONG --> SWOLE TOAD --> KING K. ROOL

sonic texture reimplemented to replace vacation luigi on bikes, running luigi for mach bike still works
-----------------------------------------------------fixes:----------------------------------------------------
menu icons for:
cosmicclone (baby mario)
kid yoshi (baby luigi)
pikachu (baby peach)
sonic (luigi)
tails (daisy)
steve (yoshi)
goomba stack (birdo (catherine))
sans (wario)
king k. rool (donkey kong)

TEXTURES ARE NOW IMPLEMENTED FOR MULTIPLAYER RACES
-----------------------------------------------------issues:---------------------------------------------------
results menu still shows original icons (except for tails ???), i don't see this as important enough to spend
time fixing

selection models missing for birdo and wario, i would fix this but it is complex artwork and the files simply
don't exist (if anyone wants to spend time rendering them in the correct format just send me the
files once your done and i'll include them

GOOMBA STACK: menu model doesn't work, in game model only works for cars

SANS: menu model doesnt work, in game model only works for bikes (and accidentally piranha prowler although
its a bit janky), he is also in an orange jacket rather than blue because i used the wrong bres files and
can't be bothered to change them all, custom icons added from google as none were packaged with the textures

random crashes still happen for unknown reason, believed to be part of the original wiimms
mod and something i can't be bothered to fix, possibly an issue with specific courses

wiimmfi multiplayer does not work as it requires each user to have unique files copied from a different
wii machine, users can implement this themselves if they wish but i have no intention of doing it
-----------------------------------------------------notes:----------------------------------------------------
I've decided to start keeping a changelog. this is due to the fact that normally during the first run through
or setup, i would explain which things work, which things don't, and where any issues are; this information is
now easily available and rereadable in the (hopefully) concise format of a text file



first test of icon replacement successful (tails for daisy),
character selection menu:

data>files>scene>UI>MenuSingle.szs>.>control>timg>tt_daisy_64x64.tpl,

minimap: 
data>files>scene>UI>Race.szs>.>game_image>timg>st_daisy_32x32.tpl,

custom sound files exist but not yet implemented and i do not intend to implement them as none of us
ever play with sound enabled
